Use our small modules & packages to do things creatively, quickly, and without weighing you and your codebase down.

## ... open to friendly ⤜contributions⤏

We're a rag-tag, non-profit assemblage of passionate contributors. Demos, ideas, libraries - would you like to help us make something documented and coded to a high standard of quality and playfulness? 

Or if you just wanna build something wild for a game jam, that's cool too. We're always down for friendly collaboration:
